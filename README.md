# Tool-Upgrades
My Tool Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. While technically ready, it only contains Literal Seaglide Upgrades. I plan to add much much more.
## I can Promise this
Almost ALL tools will have upgrades by the time this is released.
# Release with only current set?
I have a question for all who want this mod: Do you guys want Tool Upgrades to release now and update per tool? Leave a comment to vote.
