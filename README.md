# Tool-Upgrades
My Tool Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. While technically ready, it only contains 3 of the tools to upgrade. I plan to add much much more.
## I can Promise this
Almost ALL tools will have upgrades by the time this is released.
## News
This "mod" is a library mod for the other mods (such as Literal Seaglide Upgrades, Repair Tool Upgrades, Air Bladder Upgrades, etc.). Meaning if you download this mod you can download any of the other mods that require this one and they will work. No source code yet though, I am still working on it
