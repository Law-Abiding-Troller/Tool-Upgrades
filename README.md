# Tool-Upgrades
My Tool Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. While technically ready, it only contains 3 of the tools to upgrade. I plan to add much much more.

## Note
This "mod" is a library mod for the other mods (such as Literal Seaglide Upgrades, Repair Tool Upgrades, Air Bladder Upgrades, etc.). Meaning if you download this mod you can download any of the other mods that require this one and they will work.

## Dependencies
 - Subnautica
 - BepInEx
 - Nautilus

## How to install:
1. Ensure you have the dependencies installed, if you do not, the mod will not work.

## What This Mod Adds
A hand held fabricator specifically for tools and nothing else. Found in the Fabricator under `Personal`,`Tools`. Please note that while the fabricator is hand held, it will not have charge unless near a base. I have not tested  if it will work inside of a base or without a solar panel or anything that generates power outside the base. I know the Power Transmitter will work.

## What Each Setting is:
 - Enable Debug Mode? (requires restart): Click to have a checkmark which you can test for bugs.

## Update News:
UpgradesLIB is releasing on Nexus soon!

None! Please inform me of any bugs you do find
